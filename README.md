## React Fundamentals Used
The project leverages several core React concepts and techniques, including:

- **React Hooks**: `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useContext` for managing state and side effects.
- **React Context API**: Used for managing global state, such as cart and wishlist data, across the application.
- **React Router DOM**: Utilized for navigation and routing within the app, including:
  - `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation.
  - `useLoaderData` for preloading data in certain routes.
  - Nested routing and dynamic routes for enhanced navigation structure and better user experience.

## Data Management
- **Context API**: Used to handle and manage data across different components, specifically for the cart and wishlist.

## Project Features
1. **Statistics Page with Graph**: The Statistics page displays a graphical representation of product prices, providing valuable insights for users.
2. **Cart and Wishlist System**: Users can add items to their cart or wishlist, making the shopping experience organized and user-friendly.
3. **Sort Option**: An exclusive "rich customer" sorting option to help users sort products based on higher price ranges.
4. **Enhanced User Experience with Toasts**: React-Toastify is used to provide toast notifications, delivering feedback on user actions like adding to cart or wishlist.
5. **Dynamic and Responsive Design**:
